Description: 
    Utilities functions to facilitate robust R programming. The package is meant 
    to serve as a controlled environment for development and testing. The 
    functions are not so much intended to be imported elsewhere, but instead to
    make it easy to have sane, tested, dependency-free utilities that can be 
    easily copy and pasted to use as internal functions in other packages.
